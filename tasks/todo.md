# Tank Game Enhancement Plan

## Current Tasks (High Priority)

### 1. **URGENT: Improve AI Critical Thinking and Movement**
- [x] **Analyze current AI implementation** - Found basic distance-based movement
- [x] **Identify AI issues** - Poor movement, passive shooting, no tactics
- [x] **Improve movement logic with obstacle avoidance**
  - ✅ Added wall detection and avoidance
  - ✅ Implemented smart pathfinding around obstacles
  - ✅ Added evasive movement patterns
- [x] **Enhance shooting intelligence**
  - ✅ Reduced angle threshold for shooting opportunities (0.3 → 0.4-0.8)
  - ✅ Added predictive aiming for moving targets with random error
  - ✅ Implemented spray-and-pray tactics (10% wild shots)
- [x] **Add tactical behaviors**
  - ✅ Circle-strafing around enemies with random timing
  - ✅ Multiple AI modes: hunt, strafe, retreat, powerup
  - ✅ Varied movement patterns with speed/direction randomness
- [x] **Implement power-up seeking**
  - ✅ Evaluate and seek nearby power-ups
  - ✅ Strategic mode switching for power-up collection
  - ✅ Distance-based priority system
- [x] **Add threat assessment**
  - ✅ Prioritize targets based on distance, health, power-ups
  - ✅ Consider enemy health and power-ups in targeting
  - ✅ Retreat when low health and enemy close
- [x] **Test and balance improvements**
  - ✅ Added extensive randomness for unpredictable behavior
  - ✅ Variable speed, timing, and decision thresholds
  - ✅ 20% chance for completely random mode decisions

## AI Improvements Summary
The AI now features:
- **4 distinct behavioral modes** with smart switching
- **Randomized decision making** (20% unpredictable choices)
- **Variable movement speeds** and timing
- **Predictive shooting** with intentional aim error
- **Wall avoidance** and obstacle navigation  
- **Power-up seeking** behavior
- **Threat-based target prioritization**
- **Circle-strafing** and evasive maneuvers

### 2. Add Player Item Display to Score
- [ ] Update scoreboard HTML structure to include item display area
- [ ] Modify createScoreBoard function to add item display elements  
- [ ] Add updateItemDisplays() function to show current held items
- [ ] Integrate item display updates into the game loop
- [ ] Style the item display with power-up colors and names

### 3. Improve Tank Visual Design
- [ ] Enhanced tank body with better gradients and details
- [ ] Improved cannon design with more realistic proportions
- [ ] Better turret details and hatches
- [ ] Enhanced treads and side armor panels
- [ ] More sophisticated shadow effects
- [ ] Better color blending and highlights

## Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)

### 3. Settings Screen
- [ ] Create comprehensive settings screen before game start
- [ ] Add checkboxes for each map element type (default = nothing)
- [ ] Style settings screen to match game aesthetic
- [ ] Save selected settings for game initialization

### 4. Map Elements
- [ ] Destructible walls - Break after 2-3 bullet hits, create new paths
- [ ] Teleporters - Portal pairs that transport tanks across map
- [ ] Moving platforms - Slow-moving walls creating dynamic cover
- [ ] One-way walls - Bullets pass through but tanks can't (glass-like)
- [ ] Rotating barriers - Walls that slowly rotate, opening/closing passages

### 5. Environmental Hazards
- [ ] Lava pits - Damage tanks that drive over them
- [ ] Ice patches - Make tanks slide and lose control
- [ ] Speed boosters - Temporary speed zones
- [ ] Bouncy surfaces - Walls that reflect bullets at double speed

### 6. Interactive Objects
- [ ] Switches - Activate/deactivate certain walls or barriers
- [ ] Conveyor belts - Push tanks in specific directions
- [ ] Trap doors - Open/close periodically
- [ ] Mirror walls - Reflect bullets in predictable angles

## Implementation Strategy
- Focus on current high-priority tasks first
- Keep each change simple and minimize code complexity
- Test thoroughly after each addition
- Build on existing systems without breaking functionality
